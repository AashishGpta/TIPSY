# TIPSY
TIPSY stands for Trajectory of Infalling Particles in Streamers around Young stars.
It's a python code for fitting molecular-line observations of elongated structures, often called streamers, around young stars. The objective is to check:
1. If these structures are infalling streamers?
2. If yes, then how well can we characterise them?

### IMPORTANT: This is still a work in progress, please refrain from using it for scientific publications for now.
