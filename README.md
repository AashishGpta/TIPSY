# TIPSY
TIPSY stands for Trajectory of Infalling Particles in Streamers around Young stars.
It's a python code for fitting kilo-au scale elongated structures, often called streamers, around young stars. The objective is to check:
1. If these structures are infalling streamers?
2. If yes, then how well can we characterise them?
